# Prework Study Guide Web Page

## Description

As a bootcamp student I wanted a space to store pre-work notes so that I could easily find and study the topics I learned about. I built this project so that I could better grow and develop my knowledge and skills as a student. Having all of my notes in one place that is easily accessible will help me to quickly reference and review the material at any time. While creating this study guide I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
